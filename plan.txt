High level Plan for MenU

1. Choosing of Api✅
	. My choice is Gemini Api, since it is free
	. Figure out how is the file sent and received
	. Learn how the setup is made. Like the setup of the api and writing the prompt for it.

2. Starting the Backend❌
	. Start the writing of uploading pdf api
	. Store it temporarily

3. LLM pdf forwarding
	. Now send the stored pdf to the llm
	. Make it to read it and give  you the json file (Be strict with the prompt)

4. Enforce the strictness of json✅
	. Reject if the response is not a json
	. Reject if it misses any of the fields or days
	. Retry or fail gracefully

5. Mongo DB integration✅
	. Create a mail Id or use existing one
	. Make a schema
	. store the correct json into the schema
imp	. index by date 

6. Business Logic API✅
	. write api for next meal
	. api for remaining meal of today (both before and after the next meal, but not the next meal)
	. api for this week any day menu
	. api for any day in the calander menu

7. Frontend
